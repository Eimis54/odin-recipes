        <p>These home fries turn out crispy every time. They're great for breakfast or as a side dish. If you prefer crispy hash browns, use shredded potatoes (instead of cubed) and follow the recipe directions.</p>
        <il>
         <ul>3 medium russet potatoes, cubed</ul>
         <ul> 3 tablespoons butter or margarine</ul>
         <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>   
        </il>
        <il>
            <ol>Rinse potato cubes with cold water and drain well.</ol>
            <ol>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place potatoes in the skillet and season with salt and pepper; mix well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes.</ol>
            <ol>Remove the lid and cook, turning frequently, until brown and crisp on all sides, about 10 more minutes.</ol>
